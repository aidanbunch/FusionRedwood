## Getting Started
To get started with Unpuzzle, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm i`.
3. Set up a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project and save your Supabase credentials, including the URL and API key.
4. Set up a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account and save your API keys and secret API route.
5. Set up as many as 3 [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) accounts and save their API keys.
6. Set up [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and save the ID as well as the ad client number.
5. Run the development server by running `npm run dev`.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
7. Add the following environment variables to your .env.local file:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY[0-2]`: Your OpenAI API key. You can obtain a key by signing up for an account on the OpenAI website.
Make sure to include this variable in your .env.local file and add the file to your .gitignore file to keep your key secure. Add all 3 keys in the aforementioned format.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase API keys. You can obtain them by going to the Supabase website and setting up a project. Include these variables in your .env.local file.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `API_ROUTE_SECRET`: Your Stripe keys. Again, you can get these by signing up for a Stripe account and setting up payment processing via their website.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` and `G_AD_CLIENT`: Google Analytics information. These are fine to publicly expose, but we decided to add them in the .env.local for the sake of consistency. If you want to track statistics in your instance, create a Google Analytics account and find your IDs.
